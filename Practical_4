Aim:

To model UML Use Case Diagrams and capture Use Case Scenarios for a Blood Bank Management System by identifying actors, use cases, and their interactions, and to draw the corresponding Use Case diagrams.​

Objective:

Identify and define the primary actors interacting with the Blood Bank Management System.​

Determine and describe the use cases representing the functionalities of the system.​

Develop UML Use Case diagrams illustrating the relationships between actors and use cases.​

Document detailed use case scenarios to capture the flow of events within the system.
Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a standardized modeling language used to visualize, specify, construct, and document the artifacts of a software system. A Use Case Diagram is a type of behavioral diagram in UML that represents the functional requirements of a system. It depicts the interactions between external actors and the system's use cases, providing a high-level view of system functionality.​

Identifying Actors:

In the context of a Blood Bank Management System, the primary actors include:​

Admin: Manages the overall system, including donor and patient data, blood inventory, and system configurations.​
