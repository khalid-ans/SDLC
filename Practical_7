Modeling Sequence Diagrams for Blood Bank Management System
A Sequence Diagram is a type of interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order. In a Blood Bank Management System, sequence diagrams can be used to model interactions like donor registration, blood donation, blood request by a hospital, and stock updates.

Purpose
To visualize the step-by-step interaction between system components (objects), such as donors, receptionists, the database, and the inventory system, during key operations in the blood bank.
