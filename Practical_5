Modeling Data Flow Diagram & Control Flow Diagram
Draw Data Flow Diagram | Control Flow Diagram

Aim of the Experiment
To model the flow of data and control in a Blood Bank Management System using Data Flow Diagram (DFD) and Control Flow Diagram (CFD).

Introduction
In any information system, visual representation of how data moves through the system is essential for analysis and design. DFDs help in understanding the logical flow of data, while CFDs focus on control actions. This experiment focuses on modeling both DFD and CFD for a blood bank system.

Objectives
To model how data flows across a blood bank system using DFD.

To visualize the control mechanisms and actions using a CFD.

To identify the major entities and processes in the blood bank system.

After completing this experiment you will be able to:
Identify external entities and functionalities of the blood bank system.

Identify the flow of data across the system.

Represent the system flow using Data Flow Diagrams (DFD).

Model the control actions and logic using Control Flow Diagrams (CFD).

Theory
Data Flow Diagram (DFD)
A DFD is a graphical tool that depicts the flow of data within a system. It shows how input is turned into output through a process.

Graphical Notations for Data Flow Diagram
Symbol	Meaning
üü¶ (Process)	Performs actions on data
üüß (Data Store)	Storage or database
üî≤ (External Entity)	Source/destination of data
‚ûù (Arrow)	Direction of data flow
Explanation of Symbols used in DFD
Process ‚Äì Represents a function or activity (e.g., ‚ÄúRegister Donor‚Äù).

Data Store ‚Äì Where data is stored (e.g., ‚ÄúDonor Records‚Äù).

External Entity ‚Äì Users or systems interacting with the blood bank system (e.g., ‚ÄúDonor‚Äù, ‚ÄúHospital‚Äù).

Data Flow ‚Äì Movement of data between entities, processes, and data stores.

Context Diagram and Leveling DFD
Context Diagram (Level 0 DFD)
Shows the entire Blood Bank Management System as a single process with external entities like:

Donor

Hospital

Admin

Level 1 DFD
Breaks the system into sub-processes such as:

Donor Registration

Blood Donation

Blood Request by Hospital

Inventory Management

Case Study: Blood Bank Management System
Entities:
Donor ‚Äì Registers and donates blood

Receptionist ‚Äì Manages donor records

Hospital ‚Äì Requests blood

Admin ‚Äì Manages overall system

Processes:
Register Donor

Store Blood Details

Update Inventory

Approve Blood Request

Data Stores:
Donor Database

Blood Inventory

Hospital Request Log
